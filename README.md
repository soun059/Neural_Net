# Neural_Net
A working example on Neural_net ( An idea got from playground Tensorflow)
Tensor Flow Playground is a awesome example of how neural network works and Thus its one of the must-visit places if you want to learn about Neural-Net
Now , I have created A neural net example working on a dataset inspired from TensorFlow Playground and the fine part is, IT ONLY USES NUMPY, MATPLOTLIB but no ml-tools like sklearn or tensorflow.Hope it will help you to understand about the neural-net.
